## Requirements

-   You understand what monitoring is, and why it is necessary.
-   You understand the difference between metrics and logs.

-   You understand what alerting fatigue is.
    -   You understand that fine-tuning alerts to achieve the right balance is crucial and constitutes the most significant effort when setting up a monitoring solution.
-   You understand the roles and interactions of Exporters, Prometheus, Grafana, and Alert Manager.

    -   E.g. you can explain the following image:

-   You can export metrics from a python script or a virtual machine.
-   You can set up a Grafana Dashboard to see a live graph of such metrics.
-   You can set up alerting in Alert Manager and push these to a communication software of choice (e.g. Discord, Teams, Matrix.org, etc.) when certain situations happen.
