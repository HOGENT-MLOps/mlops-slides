# Container virtualization: Docker

Although you have used Docker in various courses (System Engineering Labs, Operating systems, ...) during the past years, it can't hurt to freshen up your knowledge.

## Requirements

Go through the theory sources provided below (or find your own) to achieve the following requirements:

-   You understand the difference between containers and virtual machines, and know the pro's and con's of each.
-   You understand the role of Docker in containerization.
-   You understand the following concepts of Docker:
    -   What is an image?
    -   What is the difference with a container?
    -   What are layers, and why does Docker use them?
    -   What is a Docker registry and why do people use them?
    -   What is a volume?
    -   What is a port mapping?
    -   What is a tag?
    -   What are environment variables?
    -   What is a `Dockerfile`?
-   You can install and use `docker` commands to use all of the concepts above.

    -   In other words: you understand and can use all of the commands in following image:

        ![](./assets/01/docker-stages.png)

-   You can write a basic `Dockerfile`.
-   You can build Docker images and run them as Docker containers.
-   You can push and pull Docker images to and from a Docker registry like DockerHub.
-   You understand the role of Docker Compose in containerization.
    -   When do we use Docker Compose instead of just Docker?
-   You understand the following concepts of Docker Compose:
    -   What is a `docker-compose.yml`?
    -   How DNS works inside a single `docker-compose.yml` (e.g. how you can access another container from a container).
-   You can install `docker compose` and know how to start, stop, and update a Docker Container stack using `docker compose` commands.
-   You can view the logs generated by a Docker Compose stack.
