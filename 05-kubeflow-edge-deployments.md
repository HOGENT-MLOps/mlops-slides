# Kubeflow and edge deployments

## Learning goals

TODO: add learning goals

- Get familiar with the TensorFlow Lite framework
- Convert a TensorFlow model to a TensorFlow Lite model with quantization
- Train a quantize aware model
- Perform weight pruning on a model

# Intro

## Introduction

# Get started with the lab assignment!

## Quantization and pruning

- Use Google Colab to run `ml-workflow/quantization-and-pruning.ipynb`
- Convert a TF model into a TF Lite model with quantization
- Train a quantize aware model
- Perform weight pruning on a model
