# Intro

## Traditional release

- Weeks/months apart
- Lots of changes!
- â‡’ Lots of bugs...
  - Wait for vN.1?
- Releases are painful, high-risk events

## How e.g. Facebook does it (1)

- "If it hurts, do it more often"
- Dozens of releases per day!
- Small, incremental changes go into production
- â‡’ Reduced risk

## How e.g. Facebook does it (2)

## Typical tasks for CI

- Linting: code style checks
- Static analysis (e.g. shellcheck)
- Compilation
- Unit tests
- Code coverage analysis
- Packaging

## Typical tasks for CD

- Release to package repository
- Deploy in acceptance environment
- Deploy to production
- Integration/acceptance/load-tests...

# CI/CD tooling

## Overview

- Open source
  - [Concourse](https://concourse-ci.org/)
  - [Jenkins](https://www.jenkins.io/)
  - [Spinnaker](https://spinnaker.io/)
- Commercial on-prem
  - [Atlassian Bamboo](https://www.atlassian.com/software/bamboo)
  - [Jetbrains TeamCity](https://www.jetbrains.com/teamcity/)

---

- Commercial, hosted
  - [AWS CodePipeline](https://aws.amazon.com/getting-started/hands-on/set-up-ci-cd-pipeline/)

## Jenkins

<https://www.jenkins.io/>

- Open source
- Mature
- Most flexibility
  - on-prem/private/public cloud
  - rich feature set

## GitHub Actions

- Integrated in GitHub
- CI/CD code alongside the source code
- Free to use (with limitations)
  - Pay-as-you-go after limits are reached

## A GitHub Actions case

This slide deck was built on GitHub Actions & deployed to GitHub Pages!

Check out the source code:

<https://github.com/HOGENT-MLOps/mlops-slides/blob/main/.github/workflows/compile.yml>

## Working with GitHub Actions

- Go to Actions, New workflow
- Or create `.github/workflows/workflow-name.yml`
- [RTFM](https://docs.github.com/en/actions)

## Example workflow

```yaml
---
name: GitHub Actions Demo
run-name: ${{ github.actor }} is testing out GitHub Actions ðŸš€
on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main
jobs:
  Explore-GitHub-Actions:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Check out repository code
        uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - name: List files in the repository
        run: |
          ls ${{ github.workspace }}
      - run: echo "This job's status is ${{ job.status }}."
```

## Gitlab CI

<https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/>

- Open source
- Integrated in GitLab
- CI/CD code alongside the source code
- Also free with limits

# Deployment techniques

## Canary deployments

![](https://martinfowler.com/bliki/images/canaryRelease/canary-release-2.png)

## Blue-Green Deployment

![Acceptance/Production swap places](https://martinfowler.com/bliki/images/blueGreenDeployment/blue_green_deployments.png)

## Trunk-based development

- No more `master`/`develop`/`feature` branches
  - Branches considered harmful!
- All work done on `main`
- Short-lived feature branches

## Feature branches

![](assets/01-ci-cd/feature-branch.png)

# Get started with the lab assignment!

## Jenkins lab assignment

```console
cd dockerlab
vagrant up
vagrant ssh
```

Follow the steps in the assignment <https://github.com/HoGentTIN/infra-labs/blob/main/assignment/2-cicd.md>

Jenkins UI resides at <http://192.168.56.20:8080/>

## Setup

- Jenkins runs in a Docker container
- Default installation, minimal configuration required
- Launch demo application in another Docker container
- Make change, rebuild & deploy!

# Reflection

## Lab setup vs reality

- Complete build server
  - Physical system or "traditional" VM
  - Worker nodes
- Central repo + build tools

## Change in discipline needed!

- code coverage âŸ¶ 100%
